History and background of the association
In 1974, Khunying Kanitta Wichiancharoen, as a lawyer and always participated in the campaign on women's rights,
was aware of the problems and hardships of women who were abused by her family. Some were raped. Some people
came to find work in Bangkok but was deceived and forced into prostitution. Problem counselling on the legal side
cannot cure all problems. The social work process is important and the solution that can help another way.
At that time, there were no organizations in Thailand that specifically provided temporary accommodation for women
like in foreign countries which have institutions that focus on helping women and ready to provide
psychological counselling to restore mental health. Khunying Kanittha decided to open her house as an emergency
home. The room is not big and the house on Nakhon Chai Si Road became the starting point of the emergency
shelter at a later stage. It is Thailand's first women's and children's home run by an NGO.
This first emergency house is located on the 3rd floor of the Women Lawyers Association of Thailand Building, Sukhothai Road,
Dusit District. Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali was presented at the official inauguration of emergency home on
19 August 1982, which later in the year 1988 Her Royal Highness Princess Somsawali has graciously accepted the Association
under the patronage. The Association is a charitable organization under Association of Thailand Establishment License No.
Nor. Tor. 128/2525 by the Office of the National Cultural Commission Promotion Association.
